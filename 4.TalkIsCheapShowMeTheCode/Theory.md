# Reconciliation Algorithm: (react fiber)
- react create a virtual dom of it
- virtual dom is representation of actual dom
- 
# DIff algorithm:

- it is find out the difference between previous virtual dom and updated virtual dom 
- 

# Single Responsibilty principal:

- code should be maintainable
- testable
- readable
- reusable 
- modular

# Performace optimization

- will make smaller bundler of files this process is known as 
- chunking
- code splitting
- dynamic bundling 
- lazy loading
- on demand loading
- dynamic import
